1. We can put longer awk programs in separate scripts. For example, this program:

$ awk '{ if (NF < 8 ) {print "short line:", $0} else { print "long line:", $0 } }' dukeofyork.txt

Can be placed in a script file of its own, like this:

{                                       <---- NOTE THE OPENING BRACE FOR THE PROGRAM
    if (NF > 8) {
        print "Short line:", $0
    } else {
        print "Long line:", $0
    }
}                                       <---- NOTE THE CLOSING BRACE FOR THE PROGRAM

We can supply the program name to awk with the -f option:

$ awk -f shortlong.awk dukeofyork.txt 
Long line: The grand old Duke of York
Long line: He had ten thousand men
Short line: He marched them up to the top of the hill
Long line: And he marched them down again
Long line: And when they were up they were up
Long line: And when they were down they were down
Long line: And when they were only half-way up
Long line: They were neither up nor down
